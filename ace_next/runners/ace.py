    The full ACE loop.  An agent executes, the environment evaluates, the

    A single class handles both single-pass (``epochs=1``) and multi-epoch
    batch training (``epochs > 1``).

    Use when you are building a new agent from scratch and want
    closed-loop learning where the agent improves in real time.
