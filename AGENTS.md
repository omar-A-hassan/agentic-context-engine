# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Guidelines

### Documentation Maintenance
Before working on code in `ace/` or `ace_next/`, read `docs/ACE_DESIGN.md` to understand the current architecture.
Before working on code in `pipeline/` or `ace_next/core/`, read `docs/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` to understand the pipeline engine.

**Docs MUST be kept in sync with code.** Any change that alters a public API, renames a concept, adds/removes a module, or changes execution flow **requires** a corresponding update to the relevant docs. Do not merge code changes that make the documentation inaccurate.

Key design docs:
- `docs/ACE_DESIGN.md` — core ACE architecture: roles, skillbook, adaptation loops, insight levels, integration patterns
- `docs/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` — pipeline engine: steps, StepProtocol, Pipeline, SubRunner, RR pipeline

### Project Structure
- `ace/` — core library (skillbook, roles, adapters, integrations, observability)
- `ace_next/` — pipeline-based rewrite built on top of `pipeline/` (see `docs/ACE_DESIGN.md`)
- `pipeline/` — generic pipeline engine that `ace_next` is built on (see `docs/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md`)
- `tests/` — unit/integration tests (pytest + unittest)
- `examples/` — runnable demos grouped by integration
- `benchmarks/`, `scripts/` — research/evaluation tooling (not shipped to PyPI)
- `docs/` — guides and reference material
  - `docs/getting-started/` — installation, setup, quick-start
  - `docs/concepts/` — core concepts: roles, skillbook, insight levels
  - `docs/guides/` — in-depth guides: full pipeline, integration, testing, prompts
  - `docs/integrations/` — per-integration docs (LiteLLM, LangChain, browser-use, Claude Code, Opik)
  - `docs/pipeline/` — pipeline engine docs: core concepts, custom steps, branching, error handling
  - `docs/api/` — API reference
  - `docs/ACE_DESIGN.md` — architecture design doc (keep in sync with code)
  - `docs/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` — pipeline engine design doc (keep in sync with code)

### Commands
- `uv sync` — install all dependencies
- `uv run pytest` — run tests (coverage enforced `--cov-fail-under=25`)
- `uv run pytest -m unit` / `-m integration` / `-m slow` — run by marker
- `uv run black ace/ tests/ examples/` — format code
- `uv run mypy ace/` — type check

### Coding Style
- PEP 8 with Black formatting (line length 88)
- Type hints and docstrings for public APIs
- Python 3.12 target
- Test files: `tests/test_*.py`; functions: `test_*`; classes: `Test*`

### Testing
- Pytest is the primary runner
- Add tests for new features; include regression tests for bug fixes

### Commits
- Conventional Commits: `feat(scope): subject`, `fix(scope): subject`
- PRs should include description, test results, and relevant docs updates

### ACE Roles (quick reference)

| Role | Responsibility | Key Class |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Agent** | Executes tasks using skillbook strategies | `Agent` |
| **Reflector** | Analyzes execution results | `Reflector` |
| **SkillManager** | Updates the skillbook with new strategies | `SkillManager` |

### Integration Agents

| Agent | Framework | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `ACELiteLLM` | LiteLLM (100+ providers) | Simple self-improving agent |
| `ACELangChain` | LangChain | Wrap chains/agents with learning |
| `ACEAgent` | browser-use | Browser automation with learning |
| `ACEClaudeCode` | Claude Code CLI | Coding tasks with learning |
