Looking at AGENTS.md:\n\n\"Every Session\"\nBefore doing anything else:\n1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are\n2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping\n3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context\n4. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`\n\nThe inbound context shows this is a direct message on Telegram (chat_type: \"direct\"), so this is a MAIN SESSION. I should read MEMORY.md.\n\nI also need to check IDENTITY.md for persona details.\n\nLet me read these files in order:\n1. SOUL.md (already in context)\n2. USER.md (already in context)\n3. IDENTITY.md (already in context)\n4. MEMORY.md (need to read)\n5. Today's memory file (need to check date first)\n\nLooking at the runtime, I don't have the current date yet. I'll need to use session_status to get it, or just try reading the memory files.\n\nActually, looking at the files loaded:\n- SOUL.md - loaded\n- USER.md - loaded, shows Name: David\n- IDENTITY.md - loaded, shows Name: openclaw\n- BOOTSTRAP.md - exists, which means this might be a first-time setup\n\nWait, BOOTSTRAP.md existing means this is the first conversation. The BOOTSTRAP.md says \"Don't interrogate. Don't be robotic. Just... talk.\" and suggests starting with \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\"\n\nBut the instruction says to execute the Session Startup sequence from AGENTS.md. Let me check what AGENTS.md says about BOOTSTRAP.md:\n\n\"## First Run\nIf `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, then delete it. \n\nYou won't need it again.\"\n\nSo BOOTSTRAP.md takes precedence. I should follow the bootstrap process.\n\nHowever, the USER.md already has \"Name: David\" filled in, and IDENTITY.md has \"Name: openclaw\" filled in. So maybe this isn't truly first boot? I need to check MEMORY.md and the daily memory files to understand whether there's existing history or if this is genuinely the first interaction.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_vrtx_014HNubtFNrbeeJT12zzBfGU","name":"read","arguments":{"file_path":"/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md"}},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_vrtx_01VeJMoaKQHn1F64oAg36GEu","name":"session_status","arguments":{}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"litellm","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":13587,"output":1128,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":14715,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1772116178054}}
